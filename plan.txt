tooling:
  SDL2 - to provide 2d drawing primitives
  SDL2_image - for images
  for fonts, possibly SDL_ttf
  do we need sound? probably not yet. SDL_mixer if later need it.
  this gonna be 2D game so we'll probably be fine by not using OpenGL but relying on SDL to provide proper drawing stuff.
build system?
  need to support windows and linux. cmake? unsure if raw makefiles would work well for this.
  which ide to use in windows? should talk well with build system... qtcreator? code::blocks?
  visual studio would work too if we use separate build system for it.. which is probably doable aswell.
networking stuff?
  if we have time, could do. enet for networking code, flatbuffers for packing should be good.
structure:
  to be decided.
layout:
  .cpp/.h files in src/ folder;
  images/other additional data in data/ folder;
